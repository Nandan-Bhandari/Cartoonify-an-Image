# Cartoonify-an-Image
It is a Python-based project in which I've used several python libraries and concepts of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. This project is mainly dependent on OpenCV library. 
Before cartoonify and saving cartoonified images, I've changed the filter of the uploaded image four times.
